# LinearAlg
MAT167 Programming Project  

Pattern recognition problem of classifying handwritten digits from the USPS digits data set from the CEDAR in New York Buffalo SUNY. Compare and contrast two classification algorithms: SVD and Euclidean distance. SVD based classification is better and more accurate. Not surprising, this is a Linear Algebra class afterall haha.

coded in MatLab. wrote up in LaTeX.  
see prompt for details.
